                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">An NFT represents a certificate of authenticity or ownership of digital assets, like images, music, videos, artwork, tickets. Though often compared to cryptocurrencies that also run on the blockchain technology, NFTs are unique and can’t be traded as equivalents – the way cryptocurrencies are traded.

                                NFTs are stored on a public blockchain and contain the information about:
                                
                                    Who and when created an asset.
                                    Who and when bought the asset.
                                    At what price the asset was bought.
                                    Who owns the asset at the moment.
                                .</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Non-Fungible Token or NFT marketplace is such a marketplace that functions as a public Blockchain platform. However, this platform is gaining traction and driving developers and businesses to construct a marketplace, despite being in its nascent stage. 

                                Online marketplaces for digital assets are the recent talk of the fintech town. But, of course, you have to build your own marketplace if you are planning to set foot in the digital market. The words cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology are no longer unknown, and many people trade goods on several marketplaces. </p>
